# Calculator

## Description

This code was to test my JavaScript skills and to create a working calculator that does basic arithmatic

## Troubles

The actual functionality of the calculator was not a challenege but using css to make sure everything looked good was more troublsome

- When i tried to add a jpg backround I had to ask for help from a more knowledgeable person to solve the problem
- When i was moving around/adjusting the text it would readjust the rest of the div box
